# Parallel Computing Applied to Industrial Problems

This repository contains the material corresponding to the webinar/Hands-on: _Parallel Computing Applied to Industrial Problems_. The objectives are:

1. **Present** quickly and objectively concepts of Code Portability and Optimization;
2. **Show** through simple examples the use of Parallel and Distributed Programming in multi-GPU systems;
3. **Expose** students to applicability in case studies.

Material available in \*.ipynb (Jupyter NoteBook) format. There are 4 notebooks in this repository:

## [1-introduction.ipynb]
The introductory notebook contains some of the webinar's content, and through some basic commands, we will be able to characterize the available supercomputing environment.

## [2-heat.ipynb]
This NoteBook shows a case study of an application that will measure the thermal conductivity of a metallic structure.

## [3-wave.ipynb]
This NoteBook shows a case study of an application that processes seismic modeling through a 1D wave.

## [4-finalExercise.ipynb]
We end with a suggestion for applying the concepts learned in a case study called: _Simulation N-Body_.
